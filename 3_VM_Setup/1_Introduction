Inside our computer we can create a virtual computer.
	What is virtualization
		One computer does the job of multiple computers (multiple OS).

To run app/services we need server
Physical computers (Servers in Datacenter)
One service- One Server (Isolation)
Servers are always overprovisioned
Server Resources mostly underutilized
Huge Cap Ex & Op Ex.
